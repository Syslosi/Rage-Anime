## To create a site the following languages are needed to be learnt :

(i) HTML ( HyperText Markup Language ) - For giving structure

(ii) CSS ( Cascading Style sheets ) - For styling

(iii) JAVASCRIPT - For interactivity

The above languages are front-end.

Back-end Languages :

(i) PYTHON

(ii) SQL ( Structured Query Language ) - For Database management

There are many other back-end languages used for web development but for starters these languages are fine.

For coding VS Code is strictly required.
